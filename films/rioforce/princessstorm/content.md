A film 6 years in the making is finally complete. I've been working on "Princess Storm" since 2015... writing, animating, re-writing, re-animating... I had given up on ever finishing the film... until last year, I decided to give it my best shot and finish it as my thesis film for my university film degree. So here we are! My longest animation to date. I put a lot into this, and I'm really excited to share this with you.
