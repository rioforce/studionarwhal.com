MADE IN (under) 24 HOURS! Yep, that's right. I started at 7:00 am on January 3, 2015, and am ending when this finished uploading at about 5:00 am on the 4th. Made for a contest, and I got 7th place!

To make sure that the contestants didn't cheat and create their entries early, there are mod elements and a theme announced right when the contest begins. This year's theme was "A Fresh Start", and the mod elements were a "Black brick connected to a blue brick", and/or "The letter N". I didn't use the letter mod, instead I connected black and blue in every shot of the film.
