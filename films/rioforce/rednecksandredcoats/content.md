A family of southern rednecks have an unusual encounter with a being from another land...

I made this film in the summer of 2014 as my summer brickfilm project. It all started one day when I was collaborating with church friends about brickfilm ideas. Well, needless to say, I wrote the script and began production. I originally planned on two of my friends to voice in the film, but it worked out that only one could. I actually never completed the film all the way. Some sound effects, voices, etc are incomplete/missing. Enjoy!
