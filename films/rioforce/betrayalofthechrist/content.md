Danger is on the horizon. Jesus is at the breaking point, praying with his disciples for deliverance from a fate he knows must come to pass. During the night, the Pharisees and their militia ambush Jesus and his disciples, arresting Jesus in a skirmish. Betrayed by one of his closest companions, Jesus knows his life is in his father’s hands but finds his friendships–and his resolve–put to the ultimate test.
