Getting a new LEGO set is a treasured experience.

---
A film I originally made for the LEGO ReBrick Creator 3in1 contest. (Unfortunately it was disqualified because I apparently built two things instead of just one.)

I had a longer script with more middle, but I ran out of time because I procrastinated so much, so I decided instead to just go with what I have and upload it. What do you think? What do you do when you first get a new LEGO set? I'd love to hear your stories in the comments. :)
