This is the tale of a heroic explorer who beats all odds and battles evil once and for all!

If you watch this movie closely, you will notice that I used all the key parts of story telling (character development, plot with back-story, climax, and resolution) and displayed them in a humorous way. If you are a fan of the old LEGO Adventurers theme, then you will recognize all of the characters in this film.
