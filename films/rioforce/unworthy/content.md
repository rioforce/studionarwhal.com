Remember your worth.

Deuteronomy 31:6 - Be strong and of good courage, do not fear nor be afraid of them; for the LORD your God, He is the One who goes with you. He will not leave you nor forsake you.

My first animation with a puppet I made! Was fun to make and animate. Look forward to some more random puppet short films in the future, because puppet making is fun.
